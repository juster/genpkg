genpkg
A next generation package generator generator!

INSTALLATION

genpkg is installed under the home directory. Sorry if you don't like it but
adjusting things so it would work system-wide is not high on my priorities
just yet. A directory called ~/.genpkg is created which contains the preps/
dir contents and a var/ directory for storing data files (like perl module
indices).

Scripts inside the bin/ directory of the source distribution for genpkg are
installed under ~/bin. For genpkg to work you must have the dir containing
the scripts in your $PATH. The included setup script will copy files into
their proper place.

Run ``./setup genpkg'' to install the bin/ scripts and initialize the ~/.genpkg
directory. This also installs the preps/ scripts under ~/.genpkg. The setup
script will create a ~/pkg/dest directory, the default location where package
files like PKGBUILD are created.

Run ``./setup mods'' to install the modification scripts from the mods/
directory to ~/pkg/mods.
